## About  

This is a pseudo 3d Car-Racing game made in C++. <br>
The project was done mainly to understand the concurrency patterns. We have made extensive use of concurrent features of C++ in both communication (between game server and the client) and gameplay. The project also follows many design patterns and good practices.
